# Blob Detector

Code for the blob detector using Laplacian of Gaussian filter built from 
scratch for ECE558 Digital Image Processing. Image pyramid scale space 
generation, laplacian of gaussian, separable convolutions, and non-max 
suppression all developed from scratch. Check out the 
[REPORT](ECE558_FinalProject.pdf) for more details. 
The [results](results) are pretty cool too
